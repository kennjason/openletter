<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Docker, Inc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">144 Townsend Street</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco, CA 94107</span></p>
<p style="color: #5e9ca0;"><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Singh, Mr. Hykes:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an active member of the Go, Docker, and Kubernetes communities, I&rsquo;m at a loss for words with regards to the lack of management intervention in both past and recent incidents of harassment of colleagues in the community by Docker team members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our communities are the only reason that we succeed, and for that success to be viable long term, each member of the community must feel safe, valued, and comfortable. &nbsp;As a corporation, Docker is responsible for the behavior of its employees in public and private spaces when they operate under the purview of Docker&rsquo;s umbrella. &nbsp;Your responsibility goes beyond the fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders; it extends to your customers, vendors, partners, and users. &nbsp;Your success hinges on your ability to provide value to customers, and that can only be done with the help and evangelism of a happy and prosperous community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Go, Docker, and Kubernetes communities are not willing to accept harassment in any form. &nbsp;As a member of these communities, I demand better than this of myself and those around me. &nbsp;This group of people has been the most caring and welcoming group I&rsquo;ve ever seen in more than 25 years of programming. &nbsp;I refuse to stand by idly and allow bad actors to destroy the goodwill and harmony we&rsquo;ve worked so hard to achieve. &nbsp;Our community is great because we made it this way. &nbsp;Each of us: your users, your contributors, your partners, and your employees have chosen to belong to this group not just because of the value of a container solution, but because of the value of the community of helpful and caring people that comes with it.</span></p>
<p style="color: #5e9ca0;"><span style="color: #000000;">Docker has found technical and commercial success by making cutting edge technology accessible to a broad population of developers and by fostering an ecosystem of related projects that work well together. &nbsp;Tolerating and therefore tacitly endorsing bullying and intimidating behavior by your own team members undermines the ingredients of your success and threatens to sour the goodwill that has made Docker a de facto standard. &nbsp;The treatment you tolerate toward contributors to your ecosystem foreshadows the treatment you will tolerate toward the customers who invest in adopting your products.</span></p>
<p style="color: #5e9ca0;"><span style="color: #000000;">I demand that you take immediate action to permanently end this harassment. &nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not right for the people in your community, and it&rsquo;s not right for Docker, Inc. &nbsp;Failure to fix this breach in our trust will result in this community finding another place to call home. &nbsp;Docker must hold its employees to a code of conduct for public and private behavior.</span></p>
<p style="color: #5e9ca0;"><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking forward to your prompt response,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
